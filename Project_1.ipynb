    "Answer the following questions in detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What is the purpose of normalizing the input data in both TensorFlow and PyTorch implementations?\n",
    "Answer: Normalizing the input data makes it between 0 and 1, instead of between 0 and 255, which will optimize the calcuation on both CPU and GPU.  It will also make \n",
    "2. Explain the role of the activation function relu in the neural network.\n",
    "Answer: Activation function helps neural network to learn complex patterns by interduce non-linearity in the passes.  Relu is the simplest of the activation function which makes the passes faster. \n",
    "3. Why is it important to use GPU for training neural networks?\n",
    "Answer: Since GPU is optimized for doing math calculations, it will make training neural networks much faster compare to CPU alone.\n",
    "4. Compare the training time and accuracy of the TensorFlow and PyTorch models. Which one performed better and why?\n",
    "Answer: The accuracy of Tensorflow seems to preformed better, also the amount of time Tensorflow takes to excute the code was also a lot shorter. Since I expect the opposite effect, I cannot say why Tensorflow perform better.  I expect with Pytorch running GPU optimization, it would have been a lot faster.  However, it could be that Window Subsystem for Linux is not really optimizing the GPU.  \n"
